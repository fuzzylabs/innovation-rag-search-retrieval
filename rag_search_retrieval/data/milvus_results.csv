A Beginner’s Guide to Designing Embedded System ApplicationsFigure 1.23 shows how different elements of the STM32F429ZIT6U microcontroller  are mapped 
to the Zio and Arduino-compatible headers of the NUCLEO-F429ZI board. Some other elements 
are mapped to the CN11 and CN12 headers of the NUCLEO-F429ZI board, as will be discussed in upcoming chapters. Further information on these headers is available from [17].
In this chapter, buttons were connected to the NUCLEO board using pins D2 to D7. From Figure 1.23, 
it can be seen that those digital inputs can also be referred to as PF_15, PE_13, P_14, PE_11, PE_9, and PF_13, respectively. Throughout this book, many pins of the ST Zio connectors will be used, and they will be referred to in the code using the names shown in Figure 1.23.",0.30795398354530334,8.811583518981934,0.03252247488101534,0.719777735783016,0.032266458495966696,0.719580723058571,0.04839549075403121,0.719777735783016,0.475778192281723

37The STM32F429ZIT6U microcontroller includes a Cortex-M4 processor , as shown in Figure 1.22. It 
can be appreciated that, beyond the processor, the microcontroller includes other peripherals such as 
communication cores (ethernet, USB, UART, etc.), memory, timers, and GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) ports.

Abstraction Layer) ports that allow Mbed to transparently run on microcontrollers from different manufacturers, are introduced.
In the final chapter, the main ideas are summarized by means of an irrigation system, shown in

"This section will begin the implementation of the smart home system, following the diagram shown in Figure 1.3. This first implementation will detect fire using an over temperature detector and a gas detector and, if it detects fire, it will activate the alarm until a given code is entered.  For this purpose, the NUCLEO board [1] provided with the STM32F429ZIT6U microcontroller [9] (referred to as the STM32 microcontroller ) is used.",0.2688245177268982,12.44285774230957,,0.5458909916868062,0.01639344262295082,0.5471918768436008,0.032266458495966696,0.5458909916868062,
"WaRNINg: Keil Studio Cloud translates the C/C++ language code into assembly code while considering the available resources of the target board. For this reason, the reader should be very careful to use only pin names that are shown in Figure 1.23.
From the above discussion, it is possible to derive the hierarchy that is represented in Figure 1.24. It should be noted that a given Arm processor can be used by different microcontroller manufacturers, and a given microcontroller can be used in different development boards or embedded systems. 
Figure 1.24 Hierarchy of different elements introduced in this chapter.
NOTE:  A microcontroller may have one or many processors, while a processor may have one or many cores. A microprocessor consists of the processor, named in this context as the Central Processing Unit (CPU), and uses an external bus to interface with memory and peripherals.
