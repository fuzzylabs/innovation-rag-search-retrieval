The aim was to study and teach embedded system technologies, a topic that was not very developed at the university at that time. Pablo Gomez and Ariel Lutenberg were among this group.\\nDuring the following years, many undergraduate and graduate courses on embedded systems, as well \\nas related courses, were organized by the group. Events on embedded systems were also held, and, in this way, a network of embedded systems professors was organized in Argentina. \\nIn this context, an open hardware and software project named “Proyecto CIAA ” (Computadora \\nIndustrial Abierta Argentina, Argentine Open Industrial Computer) was developed.

After this experience, the idea of writing this book arose as a way to disseminate our ‘learn-by-doing’ teaching approach applied to embedded system more broadly.\\nThis book follows our “learn-by-doing” approach, supported by hands-on activities.  Basic ideas \\nare explained and then demonstrated by means of examples that progressively introduce the fundamental concepts, techniques, and tools. In this way, a range of knowledge of electronics, informatics, and computers is introduced.  \\nTheoretical concepts are kept to a minimum while still allowing students to properly understand \\nthe proposed solutions. Thus, the target audience of this book is beginners who have never before programmed embedded systems, or even had any prior knowledge of electronics.\\nArm technology and C/C++ technology was chosen for this book because of the remarkable results'),\n",

The NUCLEO-F429ZI board was selected because of its ubiquity and low cost, and because it provides a broad set of interfaces that allows us to connect a wide variety of devices, as will be shown in the examples.\\nThrough the examples, a smart home system that is shown in Figure\\xa01 is gradually built. It is provided with \\nan over temperature detector and a gas detector in order to implement a fire alarm. It also has a motion sensor that is used to detect intruders. If a fire or an intruder is detected, an alarm that is provided with a siren and a strobe light is turned on. T o turn off the alarm, a code should be entered using the alarm control panel. If the code is incorrect, then the Incorrect code LED is turned on. Up to five codes can be entered before the system is blocked, which is indicated by means of the System blocked LED.'),\n",

The \\naim is to help the reader to get all the components needed to implement the setups used in each chapter. \\nThere is an additional bill of materials in T able 4, which lists the materials used in Chapter 12. These are \\nnot essential because the concepts that are introduced in this chapter can be learned without connecting all of the elements. For example, if the solenoid valve is not connected, the reader will still be able to see the relay module switching on and off, and the moisture sensor can be mocked using a potentiometer.\\nIn addition, many tools are included in the listing shown in T able 5 because they may be useful. \\nT able\\xa03 Bill of materials (BOM) used in Chapters 1 to 11.\\nChapter Component/Module Quantity\\n1NUCLEO-F429ZI 1\\nJumper wires (male–male) 80\\nUSB–micro USB cable 1\\nBreadboard 2\\nT actile switches 10\\n2 (The same elements are used as in Chapter 1.) –'),\n",

The parameters USBTX and USBRX indicate that those pins are to be used for transmission and reception of the data of the serial communication, respectively. The parameter 115200 is used to configure the baud rate of the serial communication. In the Under the Hood section of this chapter, the main concepts behind serial communication will be analyzed in more detail.\\nIn the definition of the variables, the data type char is used for the variables that are storing \\ncharacters. This is because Mbed OS uses this data type to store characters. This data type has 8 bits, the same as the data package that is exchanged in each message using the serial communication.

One of the reasons for this change is that uartUsb.read() was used in uartT ask() in such a way that the responsiveness of the program was affected. In particular, uartUsb.read() was used four times in uartT ask(): first, to assess if there is a readable character in uartUsb ; second, to get the four digits of the numeric code, one after the other; \\nthird, to get the four digits to set a new numeric code, one after the other; and fourth, to flush uartUsb  \\nonce a new date and time had been set.

This bus has some similarities and differences to the UART communication that was introduced in Chapter 2. Firstly, on each device there is only one pin that is used to exchange data with other devices, called SDA (Serial Data Line ), \\nwhile in the UART serial port each device has a TxD pin to transmit data and an RxD pin to receive data. Secondly, there is a pin called SCL (Serial Clock Line ), which is used to establish a common \\nclock signal  used to control the timing of the data interchange.

Throughout this book, many pins of the ST Zio connectors will be used, and they will be referred to in the code using the names shown in Figure 1.23.   \n3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            This section will begin the implementation of the smart home system, following the diagram shown in Figure 1.3. This first implementation will detect fire using an over temperature detector and a gas detector and, if it detects fire, it will activate the alarm until a given code is entered.  For this purpose, the NUCLEO board [1] provided with the STM32F429ZIT6U microcontroller [9] (referred to as the STM32 microcontroller ) is used.   \n4  Index\\n567 STM 32F429 ZIT 6U microcontroller 5, 33, 37, 38 \\n stop bit 46, 64, 65, 80, 256 , 257 , 273 , 468  \\n ST Zio connectors xiv, 6, 9, 37, 38, 44, 346  \\n superloop 13, 519  \\n synchronous communication 255\\nT TCP server 456 , 457 , 459 , 460 –463 , 491  \\n temperature sensor 4, 5, 87, 106 , 123 , 182 , 220 , 233 , 334 , 486 , 550  \\n time management xvi, 86, 95, 99, 289 , 342 , 348 , 353  \\n timers xvi, xxvii, 37, 306 , 342 , 343 , 345 , 348 –350 , 353 , 354 , \\n 361 , 441 , 512 –517 , 533 , 535 , 537 , 538 , 539  \\n tm structure 153  \\n TO- 220  package 89\\nU UART xvi, xvii, 5, 44, 61, 63, 79, 82, 84, 86, 181 , 191 , 222 , 255 , 290 , 291 , \\n 306 , 350 , 420 , 423 , 447 , 455 , 461 , 465 , 468 , 544  \\n USB xiv, xxvii, 4, 9, 37, 44, 45, 63, 79, 82, 88, 132 , 449 , 506 , 507 ,...   \n\n      Score  \n0  0.406629  \n1  0.312081  \n2  0.307954  \n3  0.268825  \n4  0.245208  "
